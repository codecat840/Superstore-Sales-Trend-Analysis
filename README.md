# Superstore-Sales-Trend-Analysis
This analysis involves examining historical sales-related to identify patterns, growth trends, seasonal variations, and data anomalies. The goal is to understand how the products and services are performing over time, as well as it will support strategic decision-making for later improvements.

ðŸ§  Project Objectives
1. to identify patterns, growth trends, seasonal patterns, and data anomalies
2. o understand how the products and services are performing over time
3. to uncover the strategies to support in decision-making for further improvements

ðŸ“ˆ Steps performed
import python libraries
Load and merge the dataset
Removed duplicates and null values
Change data type based on analysis
Created Monthly Sales, Sales per item
Create a cleaned dataset to import in PowerBI
Use proper chart to analyse the trend of sales
Prepare a dahsboard by using the cleaned dataset

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Python	- Data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Pandas, NumPy -	Data manipulation and aggregation
Matplotlib, Seaborn -	Visualization and trend analysis
Power BI	- Interactive dashboards and report building
Google Colab Notebook	- Python code and data exploration

ðŸ’¡Key insights
ðŸ”¹ Profitability Imbalance
Some product categories (e.g., Technology) are high in both sales and profit, while others (like Office Supplies) often operate at low or negative marginsâ€”especially in the Southern region.

ðŸ”¹ Discounting Strategy
Discount is not directly related with higher profits whereas sub-categories with frequent deep discounts tend to be unprofitable. A revised pricing strategy could help.

ðŸ”¹ Regional Opportunities
The regional opportunities are not equally distributed. Western and Central regions consistently outperform others in sales. However, the South shows potential for growth if operational costs can be reduced.

ðŸ”¹ Shipping Delays
Standard Class shipments contribute to slower deliveries. Promoting Second Class or Same Day options might improve customer satisfaction in key cities.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations
1. Optimize Inventory Based on Regional Demand Trends
2. Revise Discounting and Pricing Strategy
3. Leverage machine learning models in Python (e.g., ARIMA, XGBoost) to forecast monthly sales and profit. Integrating these models into Power BI using Python scripts will allow dynamic forecasting to support decision-making and budget planning.
